# README

TwentyOne to Ninety is a habit tracker that helps users track their habits for 21 days. If users meet 21 straight days, users have an option to extend a tracking period to 90 days for that habit.

This breakable toy integrates React front-end onto Ruby on Rails with a PostgreSQL database and Foundation framework with custom CSS. I also incorporated the back end logic using Date objects to track usersâ€™ daily check-ins to display overall progress on their habits.
